            <p> Stuttering is a speech disorder that interrupts the normal flow of speech. It is characterized by repeated sounds, syllables, or words, as well as prolonged sounds and involuntary pauses known as blocks. These disruptions can make it challenging for individuals to communicate smoothly. Stuttering often begins in childhood but can continue into adulthood. The exact cause of stuttering is not fully understood, but it may involve genetic, neurological, and environmental factors. While there is no cure for stuttering, various therapies can help improve speech fluency and communication skills.
