        <h1>Speech and Language Therapy</h1>
        <br>
        <h5>What is Speech Therapy?</h5>
        <p>Speech therapy assesses and treats speech disorders and related communication problems (such as voice, fluency, stuttering), swallowing, and feeding problems for all age groups.
          Speech Therapists or Speech Language Pathologists (SLPs) assess, diagnose and develop customized treatment plans for children with language and speech disorders and other speech impairments caused by strokes, injuries, or other illnesses.</p>
        <h5 style="color: navy;">What Are the Common Speech Disorders?</h5>
        <br>
        <!-- <h5 style="color:#fd19c2">1. Inattention:</h5> -->
        <div style="margin-left: 20px;">
          <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li><a style="font-weight: bold;">Articulation Disorders – </a> It is the inability of an individual to produce proper sounds of certain words or mispronounce words. Children with articulation disorder often swap, drop, add, or distort certain word sounds.</li>
            <li><a style="font-weight: bold;">Fluency Disorders –</a> This speech disorder affects the speed, flow, and rhythm of the child’s speech, such as cluttering and stuttering. Children with stuttering disorder often face problems with partial-word repetitions, abnormal stoppages, and prolonged syllables and sounds. In cluttering, children speak rapidly and often merge words.</li>
            <li><a style="font-weight: bold;">Voice/ Resonance Disorders –</a>This speech disorder occurs due to the blockage of regular airflow in the oral or nasal cavity that alters the vibrations affecting the volume, pitch, and quality of voice. It is linked to swollen tonsils, cleft palate, and neurological disorders.</li>
            <li><a style="font-weight: bold;">Aphasia – </a>This communication disorder affects the child’s ability to understand and speak with others. Children with this acquired disorder face difficulty in reading and writing. One of the most common causes of aphasia is stroke.</li>
            <li><a style="font-weight: bold;">Dysarthria – </a>It refers to slurred and slow speech due to children’s inability to control speech muscles. This speech disorder is caused by defects in the nervous system that cause weakness of the tongue and thought or facial paralysis.</li>
          </ul>

        </div>
        <h5 style="color: navy;">Why Do You Require Speech Therapy?</h5>
        <br>
        <div style="margin-left: 20px;">
          <p> Several neurological disorders can affect our ability to speak, chew, and swallow. This is because these disorders affect an individual’s ability to move their jaw, lips, throat, tongue, and larynx. Prompt speech therapy can help you regain these movements and ultimately improve your speech.
            <br>
            <br>
            If you or your child stutter, repeat or stretch out words while speaking, speech therapists can help overcome your stuttering problems and situational fears.
            <br>
            <br>
            People with impaired speech resulting from trauma, stroke, or any other brain damage find it difficult to pronounce certain words; speech and language therapy can help you with that by employing appropriate speech therapies.
            Individuals with a motor speech disorder (dysarthria) tend to have weak, damaged, or paralyzed muscles that result in slurred and difficult-to-understand speech. Similarly, people with aphasia cannot produce or process language, read, write, or even speak. Speech Therapy help re-train the brain of such people to improve their comprehension and communication skills.

        <div style="margin-left: 20px;">
          <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <p>Speech therapy starts with an initial assessment in which speech and language therapist attempt to identify the type of speech disorder, its possible causes, and suitable treatment. Speech therapy depends on various factors such as age and type of language disorder you have.</p>
            <li>For Children – Speech therapy for children may take place in small groups, in classrooms, or one-on-one, considering the type of speech disorder. It usually involves varying activities, play, and exercises depending on your child’s age, disorder, and specific needs. During speech therapy for kids, Speech therapists may interact with kids either through playing, talking, or using pictures and books as a part of language intervention. They may also model correct syllables and sounds for children to teach them how to make the right sound.</li>
