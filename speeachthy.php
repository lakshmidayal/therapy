            <li><a style="font-weight: bold;">Children with Physical Disabilities: – </a> It is the inability of an individual to produce proper sounds of certain words or mispronounce words. Children with articulation disorder often swap, drop, add, or distort certain word sounds.</li>
            <li><a style="font-weight: bold;">Children: –</a> This speech disorder affects the speed, flow, and rhythm of the child’s speech, such as cluttering and stuttering. Children with stuttering disorder often face problems with partial-word repetitions, abnormal stoppages, and prolonged syllables and sounds. In cluttering, children speak rapidly and often merge words.</li>
            <li><a style="font-weight: bold;">Individuals with Speech Disorders: –</a>This speech disorder occurs due to the blockage of regular airflow in the oral or nasal cavity that alters the vibrations affecting the volume, pitch, and quality of voice. It is linked to swollen tonsils, cleft palate, and neurological disorders.</li>
